## Geographic Scope

Our analysis spans the vast landscapes of the United States, encompassing a diverse array of metropolitan areas, each with unique challenges and stories in air quality management.

## Timeframe

Covering a critical 23-year period from 2000 to 2023, this era marks significant industrial advancements, population growth, and environmental policy changes that have impacted air quality.

## Cities Analyzed

A comprehensive city-wise exploration that includes major urban centers like Los Angeles, New York, Houston, and emerging focal points such as Phoenix and Charlotte.

## Data Sources

The data for this project was obtained from various reputable sources, including governmental environmental agencies and public health organizations. The datasets include AQI measurements, pollutant concentrations, and demographic information.

## Key Insights

### Concentration of Pollutants
- **California's Exposure**: California is highly exposed to pollutants, with a significant 32.81% share of the total AQI, indicating substantial pollution concerns.

### State AQI Overview
- **Los Angeles**: Los Angeles has the highest AQI count at 901,428, followed by Phoenix and New York, highlighting significant air quality issues in California.

### Dominant Pollutant
- **Ozone (O3)**: Ozone is the dominant pollutant, contributing to 70.42% of the total pollution count among the four major pollutants (NO2, SO2, CO, O3).

### Seasonal AQI Breakdown
- **Fall Peaks**: The highest AQI recorded during the fall, representing 22.61% of the total AQI.

### Monthly Trends in Pollutant Release
- **Ozone in Summer**: Higher O3 levels in summer (May to August) and increased NO2 levels in winter, particularly in December.

### Population and AQI Correlation
- **Population Impact**: A possible correlation between population size and AQI, suggesting higher emissions with larger populations.

### Long-Term AQI Trends
- **Overall Improvement**: A slight overall decrease in AQI in later years, indicating possible improvements in air quality and effective pollution control measures.

## Visualizations

The analysis includes various visualizations created using Tableau, such as:
- Heatmaps
- Bar charts
- Pareto charts
- Trend lines
- Butterfly charts

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals regional variations, seasonal trends, and correlations between population density and AQI. Despite improvements in some areas, persistent issues with ozone highlight the need for continued efforts in air quality management.
